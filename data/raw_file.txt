A Short Story

The other day I bought a lot of things at the store.  I bought a $5 dog, some string, a $10 pig, I also found a $15 horse.  The horse was the most expensive.  There's no reason to believe that the horse couldn't be more expensive.

When all was said and done, the $45 I had was basically gone.  I think I had bought a $3 coffee as well, but it's not even worth mentioning.  The 7 dollar cheeseburger was also cheap, but it wasn't very good.  The worst was the fact that I needed $1,342 to pay for a haunted doll that I had bought.  Isn't a haunted doll a little gauche?

Anyway, it's pretty freaky really.  When I showed it to my mom it made a spooky "OooooOOOooo!" noise and my mom really screamed: "Yeaaaaahaha!", her scream sounded like the sound that Goofy makes when he goes skiing, if that makes sense.

So, once I got the doll, and my mom got scared, she wanted to send me to live with my auntie and uncle in Bel Aire, which is a town just outside Ottawa.  I wanted to call them first, so she had me dial them at (613)555-0119.  They weren't home, so I called their neighbors at 613-555-0120, who also weren't home, but the sequential numbering system was pretty easy to figure out, so I just dialed 613 555-0118 to get their other neighbour.

Do you like references?  I like them too.  I like referencing one paper (Goring, 1970), but I'll also cite two or three at once: (Pangolo et al., 2013; Bonn, 1997).

Anyway, that's all I've got to say really.
