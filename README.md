## Description

This repository contains two main elements.  The `tutorial.Rmd` file is intended to be used to teach participants how to use the `stringr` package for R.  The `ui.R` and `server.R` files run the Shiny application.

Within the `data` folder is a single file, containing some raw text that can be used in the tutorial, and is loaded by the application to provide examples for the users.
